          <p>Hi, I’m Milka Keza ISINGIZWE!</p>
          <p>
            I’m a software engineer and entrepreneur with a passion for building
            innovative solutions that make a <br />difference. Born and raised
            in Kigali, Rwanda, I've always been curious about how things work,
            which <br />
            naturally led me to pursue a career in technology.

          <p>My Journey</p>
          <p>
            From the first time I wrote a line of code, I was hooked. I enjoy
            the challenge of problem-solving and the <br />satisfaction of
            seeing a project come to life. After diving into software
            engineering, I realized that what I <br />love most is creating
            meaningful products that help people and drive change. This passion
            for impact <br />
            also fuels my entrepreneurial spirit.

          <p>What I love</p>
          <p>
            I’m particularly excited about [mention a specific technology or
            area of interest], and I love working on <br />projects that require
            creativity and critical thinking. Apart from coding, I have a
            surprising passion for <br />crocheting. Yes, you read that
            right—crocheting! Even though I spend most of my time immersed
            <br />in code, I never skip my crocheting days or tutorials. Haha!
          </p>
          <p>
            When I’m not coding or crocheting, I’m often brainstorming new
            business ideas or collaborating with <br />like-minded people to
            explore solutions that have the potential to change lives.

          <p>My Cybersecurity Journey</p>
          <p>
            As much as I love building innovative solutions, I’ve found myself
            increasingly drawn to cybersecurity, <br />where my mission is to
            create a more secure cyber ecosystem. Whether I’m working on a new
            project, <br />learning about ethical hacking, or exploring the
            latest security technologies, I’m driven by a deep desire <br />to
            protect data and ensure safe digital experiences for users.
